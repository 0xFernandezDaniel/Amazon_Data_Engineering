# Amazon Analytics Pipeline with Apache Airflow
In this project, I developed a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract, transform, and load product data from a 3rd Party API to Amazon Redshift.

Business Use Case: With this code, you can retrieve any 3rd Party Amazon Seller's catalog, have it pulled into your database, and programatically check whether your vendor has those items available.
